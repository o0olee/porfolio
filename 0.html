<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
<strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
the appearance of the document.</p>

<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
using angle brackets. Tags such as "img" and "input" directly introduce
content into the page. Other tags such as "p" surround and provide information
about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do
not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

<p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript,
which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines
the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former
maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has
encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
